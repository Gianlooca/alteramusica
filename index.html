                    <a id="about">About us</a>
                </h2>
                <p><span class="alt-mus">Altera Musica</span> is an offbeat company founded in 2023 by an enthusiastic
                    ethnomusicologist
                    interested in every sort of popular and/or traditional music, a value-scout of renowned
                    or unacknowledged music genres (who physically looks for published analog recordings
                    wherever they are available) and a visionary funder... all three in the same person.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We have what we call a "museal-attitude" towards records and cassettes - especially if
                    second-hand: for us, they represent a document, a symbol, a spatial soundmark from the
                    past. If we could, as collectors, we would just put those musical findings in glass cases
                    and leave them there. But we can't and, eventually, we don't want to.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our goal is to find as many "odd" records as we can and get them into circulation, because
                    we believe in the value of the otherness, of the alterity. <span class="alt-mus">Altera
                        musica</span> is indeed a
                    latin
                    sentence
                    that echoes the name of a fundamental book, "L'altra musica", written by the italian
                    ethnomusicologist Roberto Leydi, which could be translated as "The other music"; meaning that
                    they exist other forms of making - and consuming - music, and that what we are used to listen
                    to in the famous broadcasters is just a small drop in the ocean of music history.
